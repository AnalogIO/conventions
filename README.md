This repository represents the coding conventions and other practical information for contributing to AnalogIO.

Conventions
===========
###Where to place what on the server?
Projects/repositories should be placed on the server in “/var/www/projectName/”. A roresponding .config file should then be placed in “/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectName.config” and symlinked with ```$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/filename /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/filename```. To restart the nginx server now run ```$ sudo service nginx restart ```
* Which DB to use?
* Coding style
* List of current projects
* Work flow?

Perks
===========
While coding on something relevant for AnalogIO, Analog provides free coffee.
You get to work on interesting projects, using languages and frameworks of your own choice.

Meetings
===========
In the fall semester of 2014, we meet every Thursday from 16:00 until whenever.
